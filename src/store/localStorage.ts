 * `<store.root>/Local Storage/leveldb/` — a second, sibling LevelDB database to
 * the one `store/pinstate.ts` reads, and encoded differently: a DOM Storage
 * record carries no Blink envelope and no separate "exists" entry, just a
 * one-byte type tag in front of the value's own bytes. `store/format/leveldb.ts`
 * is the same reader and writer `pinstate.ts` uses — the database format itself
 * does not change between the two origins' stores, only what is stored under
 * one key of it.
 *
 * Reading and writing both mirror `pinstate.ts`: both halves of the database
 * have to be read (a log LevelDB has folded into a sorted table no longer
 * mentions the record), the log tolerates a torn tail, and a write is an append
 * above every sequence number anywhere in the database — never a rewrite of
 * anything already there.

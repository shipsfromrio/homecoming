 * the file holds for that key *right now*, re-read inside this call rather
 * than trusted from an earlier `readGroupScopes`. `applyLayout` builds `scope`
 * from a read that can be stale by the time this runs, and — before this — a
 * single malformed entry anywhere in the target's own scope (a `null`
 * assignment is the case measured, see docs/guide) made `readGroupScopes` drop
 * that whole scope, which then made this function's plain `scopes[key] =
 * scope` wipe every group and assignment the account actually had. Merging
 * fixes both: a group, an assignment or an order list this call's `scope`
 * does not mention — well-formed or not — survives untouched, and an unknown
 * key on the scope object itself (something a newer app version keeps that
 * this codebase does not model yet) survives too.
 *
 * A backup is written first regardless, under `~/.foster/backups` — see
 * `util/backups.ts` — never next to the file it copies.
 *
 * Refused up front, before any of that, if the raw file holds a number
 * literal that `JSON.parse` / `JSON.stringify` would silently rewrite (an
 * integer past `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`, a trailing `.0`, exponent
 * notation…) — see `util/jsonNumbers.ts`. The "did a neighbour move" check
 * below compares two already-parsed trees, so a number that changed shape
 * during that same parse is invisible to it; this is the check that would
 * have caught it, so it runs first and writes nothing either way. Both are
 * `rewriteDesktopConfig`'s (`store/desktopConfig.ts`), the one rewrite path

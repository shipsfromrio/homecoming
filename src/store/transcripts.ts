/**
 * Which of `wanted` this transcript mentions as a record's own id.
 *
 * Deliberately not a JSON walk for every line. The caller asks this of every
 * transcript it can see, and on a real store that is 6.7 GB: parsing every
 * record costs 118 seconds, while matching the id shape costs under 5.
 * Nothing here needs the records — only whether an id occurs — so a first
 * pass by pattern is the whole expense of the common case, which is finding
 * nothing.
 *
 * The pattern alone over-answers, though: a structured `toolUseResult` — an
 * MCP result object, say — can quote another conversation's head as a nested
 * value, at any depth, and the pattern cannot tell that from a record naming
 * itself. Read literally, that turned a borrowed id into a false alias, which
 * `deepen` then trusted enough to mark a whole conversation stale over one
 * quoted record it never wrote. A hit against `wanted` is rare on a real
 * store, so each one is confirmed with `recordFields` — the same structural
 * reader `scanConversation` uses, which only reports a key found at a
 * record's own top level — before it counts. The pattern is still what finds
 * the hit; the structural read only ever narrows what the pattern found.
 *
 * Read in chunks, not the whole file: `readFileSync` here used to hand the
 * largest transcripts to V8 as one string, and a file past its string-length
 * ceiling (today's largest is 78 MB and growing) threw, was caught, and
 * answered "mentions nothing" — the fork it belonged to simply disappeared
 * rather than erroring loudly. A chunk costs one buffer, not the file's own
 * size, however large the file grows.
 *
 * Kept at the byte level, one `matchAll` per chunk, rather than reusing
 * `streamLines` for one `matchAll` per line: an early version did that, and
 * over a real store re-deciding "is this a complete line yet" for every line
 * of a multi-million-line corpus measured slower than the few big chunk
 * reads this does instead (`SCAN_CHUNK_BYTES`) — see that constant's own
 * comment for the numbers and their noise. `SCAN_OVERLAP_BYTES` is the
 * boundary the pattern must be kept whole across: more than `"uuid":"` plus
 * 36 hex-and-dash characters plus the closing quote, so a match cut in half
 * by one read is whole again, from the carried tail, in the next. Carrying
 * means a match inside the overlap is seen twice; `found` absorbs the repeat
 * for free, and re-validating it a second time costs nothing a real hit
 * would not have paid anyway. Validating a hit needs the whole line it sits
 * in, which the chunk it was found in may not hold entirely — `ownerLine`
 * seeks around the match's own byte offset for it, growing outward only
 * because these are rare.
 *
 * The scan itself is filtered to `wanted` as it goes — `wanted.has(id)` per
 * match, not a Map insert for every `"uuid":"…"` the pattern finds. A real
 * transcript can hold thousands of records, almost every one its own unique
 * id, and only a handful of files ever mention one of the (usually tiny)
 * `wanted` set at all: recording every match regardless of `wanted` used to
 * build a full occurrence map per file — thousands of short-lived arrays and
 * Map entries retained for the run — and that retained size, not the read or
 * the match itself, is what measured as the slower half of the GC time on a
 * real store (2,523 conversations, round 1 going from ~13 s to ~22 s).
 * Filtering inline keeps what is kept down to actual hits, which are rare.
 *
 * `cache`, when passed, is where a file's scan is remembered — see
 * `RecordIdCache`. It remembers two things per file: which ids have already
 * been searched for (found or not), and the offsets of the ones that were
 * found. A `wanted` id already searched for answers from that memory,
 * without touching the file again; a `wanted` id this file has never been
 * asked about triggers one more filtered pass over it, folded into the same
 * cache entry. `deepen` is exactly the caller this exists for: the sweep
 * calls it once per round, each round asking the same already-known files
 * about whatever new ids that round brought. A dry-run sweep — the common
 * case this is measured against — only ever calls `deepen` once, so its
 * whole cost is one filtered pass per file; a multi-round `--yes` run pays
 * one more filtered pass per file per round that hands it a genuinely new
 * id, which stays far cheaper than the read-and-validate cost the unfiltered
 * map was avoiding in the first place, since the pass itself is cheap and it
 * is the previous approach's retained memory that was slow, not the I/O.
 * Without a cache at all, every call scans fresh, filtered to whatever it
 * was asked this time — strictly less work than the old unfiltered scan,
 * never more.

 * answer, stopped the session — while `lastAssistantAt` excludes that record
 * (and a sidechain one) because it asks whether real work moved, not what was
 * last shown. See there for the bug that came from conflating the two.

 * The tail read starts at `TAIL_CWD_BYTES` and widens when that window turns
 * up nothing: measured on a real store, 22 of 7,721 transcripts have more
 * than 256 KB of bookkeeping — queue operations, retitles — written after
 * their last answer, which pushed it out of a fixed window entirely and read
 * as a session that finished cleanly rather than one `revive` should offer.
 * Each retry rereads the file at a larger size rather than tailing further
 * from where the last one stopped, which costs an extra read only for the
 * rare file that needs one; `MAX_TAIL_BYTES` is where it gives up instead of
 * reading a hundreds-of-megabytes transcript for an answer that plainly is
 * not there.
 *
 * A `user` record written after the last answer means the turn it opened never
 * closed — `cutOff`. Measured 26/09/2026: a `homecoming layout --restart --detach`
 * quit the app under eight sessions mid-turn; each transcript ended on a tool
 * result or a `<task-notification>`, with no limit record anywhere, so a
 * limit-only reading listed none of them. A user record that is the app's own
 * (`isMeta`) is passed over, and "[Request interrupted by user]" is a stop

 * A transcript's lines, a chunk of buffer at a time.

 * Read in chunks rather than whole so a large transcript costs a buffer, not its
 * own size in memory.
 *
 * The encoding is the caller's to choose because it is the second cost after the
 * parse, the same trade `idsMentionedIn` makes. `latin1` is a byte-for-byte
 * decode with nothing to validate, and it is safe for anything that only reads
 * the structure and ASCII fields out of JSON: every byte of a multi-byte UTF-8
 * character is 0x80 or above, so none of them can pass for a quote, a backslash,
 * a brace or a bracket. It also removes a hazard `utf8` has here — a character
 * split across two chunk reads decodes as replacement characters, because each
 * chunk is decoded on its own. Measured 21/09/2026 over the 40 largest
 * transcripts on this machine, 1381 MB: 10.4 s parsing utf8, 8.4 s scanning
 * utf8, 5.0 s scanning latin1.
 *
 * What it is not safe for is handing text back. A caller that wants the words of
 * a record wants `utf8`, and every caller that does asks for it.
 *
 * Exported for `scanConversation` above, the only caller so far; `engine/grep.ts`
 * does not use it — it reads a whole file at once instead (see its own comments
 * for why a chunked read does not fit the coarse-then-real shape it needs).

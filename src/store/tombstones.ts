/**
 * What the app leaves behind when a session is deleted.
 *
 * Deleting removes the session file and writes one `deleted_<id>` marker per
 * identifier the session carried — its own id, its cliSessionId, and the
 * unarchived one if it had it — each containing only the time of the deletion.
 *
 * The markers exist to stop the app's own recovery scan from offering a
 * conversation the user deliberately threw away. They do not stop the app
 * *loading* a session file that exists, which is the difference that makes an
 * accidental deletion recoverable: the pointer is gone, the conversation is not.

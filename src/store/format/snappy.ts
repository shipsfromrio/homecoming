/**
 * Snappy decompression — the raw block format, not the framed stream format.
 *
 * LevelDB compresses sorted-table blocks with Snappy by default, and Chromium's
 * IndexedDB takes the default. Reading a pinned-session list out of a database
 * that has been running long enough to compact therefore needs this, and only
 * this: homecoming never writes a sorted table, so the compressor is not required
 * and is not here.
 *
 * A compressed block is a varint holding the uncompressed length, followed by a
 * stream of elements. Each element begins with a tag byte whose low two bits say
 * what it is: a run of literal bytes, or a copy of bytes already produced. That
 * copies read from the output being built is what makes the format decompress in
 * one pass, and also why a copy may legitimately overlap the region it reads.

/**
 * Enough of LevelDB's on-disk format to read one record and append another.
 *
 * Claude Desktop keeps the sidebar's pinned sessions in Chromium's IndexedDB,
 * which is a LevelDB database — not a JSON file like everything else foster
 * touches. Reaching it needs the format itself, because the database declares
 * the comparator `idb_cmp1` and every stock LevelDB binding refuses to open a
 * database whose comparator name it does not recognise. A native dependency
 * would not have solved this; implementing the pieces actually needed does.
 *
 * **Reading** has to cover both halves of the database. New writes go to a log;
 * once that log grows, LevelDB folds it into a sorted table and the log stops
 * mentioning those records at all. Reading only the log therefore answers
 * "never written" about anything a database has had time to compact, which for
 * a long-lived one is nearly everything. Whichever copy carries the higher
 * sequence number is the current one.
 *
 * **Writing** is only ever an append to the log, and only of a whole record.
 * LevelDB replays the log in order when it opens, so a later Put supersedes an
 * earlier one: adding a record at the end changes what the database says without
 * rewriting a single existing byte. Compaction, and the manifest's edit history,
 * are left entirely to the app.
 *
 * Format (db/log_format.h, db/log_writer.cc, db/write_batch.cc, table/format.cc):
 *
 *   file    32768-byte blocks
 *   record  crc32c(4, LE, masked) | length(2, LE) | type(1) | data
 *   type    1 FULL, 2 FIRST, 3 MIDDLE, 4 LAST — a payload too long for what is
 *           left of a block is split across records rather than moved
 *   crc     masked crc32c over the type byte followed by the data
 *   payload a write batch: sequence(8, LE) | count(4, LE) | entries
 *   entry   0x01 varint(keyLen) key varint(valueLen) value   (a put)
 *           0x00 varint(keyLen) key                          (a delete)

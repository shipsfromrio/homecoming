/**
 * The CLI's registry of running sessions.
 *
 * Every live `claude` process registers itself as a JSON file under
 * `<configDir>/sessions/` — pid, session id, working directory — and removes it
 * on exit. A crash leaves the file behind, so an entry only counts when its pid
 * still answers.
 *
 * Answering is not enough on its own. Windows hands pids back out quickly, and
 * after a reboot much of a day-old registry points at whatever took the number
 * next — a database worker, a git process, the desktop app. Asking only whether
 * *a* process holds the pid says yes to all of them, so the record's own account
 * of its writer is checked against what the pid names now:
 *
 *  - the CLI records the writer's creation time in the registry file
 *    (`procStart`, a Windows FILETIME). Two processes can share a pid; they
 *    cannot share a pid *and* a creation instant, so a match is proof and a
 *    difference is proof of the opposite;
 *  - failing that — an older CLI, a record written by something else — a process
 *    younger than the record that supposedly describes it cannot be its writer,
 *    and neither can one that is plainly not a Code CLI at all.
 *
 * This is the gate in front of anything that would write to a conversation from
 * outside: a transcript with a live writer must not get a second one, and the
 * registry is the only place that says whether one exists right now. It is also
 * the gate in front of a kill, which is why the verdict is kept rather than
 * flattened to a boolean — `homecoming live --stop` may end a process it has
 * identified, and nothing else.

 * `Lineage.deepen` (`engine/lineage.ts`), the only caller `idsMentionedIn` has,
 * has carried its own in-memory `RecordIdCache` from the start
 * and was never wired to this persistent one. A cache entry nothing reads is
 * dead weight on every `save()`, not a feature kept in reserve.
 *
 * Growth-resumable: a transcript only grows, so on a size increase the bytes
 * an entry was built against are checked with a hash of the `TAIL_BYTES`
 * immediately before its stored offset — read fresh
 * from the file now, not assumed — and only a match trusts that appending is
 * all that happened; a mismatch means the file was rewritten in place, and the
 * whole thing is read again. `scanConversation`'s resumed read does not start
 * `TAIL_BYTES` before the old offset and trust that to be a line boundary —
 * `lineStartAtOrBefore` walks backward from the old offset to the nearest
 * real newline instead, however far back that is. A record still being
 * written when the entry was last saved is routinely longer than
 * `TAIL_BYTES` (a big tool result, a long assistant turn), and starting a
 * fixed `TAIL_BYTES` back can then land *inside* that record rather than
 * before it; `linesInRange` used to drop whatever came before the first
 * newline in the resumed range unconditionally, on the assumption that a
 * fragment there was already-counted leftovers — for a record longer than
 * `TAIL_BYTES` that assumption is false, and the drop silently discarded the
 * whole completed record, uuid included. Resuming from a genuine line
 * boundary instead means there is never a leading fragment to drop; every id
 * lands in a `Set`, so reading a stretch of already-known bytes twice costs
 * work, not correctness.
 *
 * Ids are stored as 16 raw bytes rather than the 36-character string a
 * transcript spells one as, a whole file's set packed and unpacked together
 * (`packUuidSet`/`unpackUuidSet`, `binary.ts`) rather than one id at a time —
 * see `packUuidSet`'s own doc for why. A string that does not pack — anything
 * not a canonical lowercase uuid, which nothing real writes — is never asked
 * to: `save()` skips persisting that file's entry rather than lose or mangle
 * the id, and the next run reads it live again.

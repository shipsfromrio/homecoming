 * file's `mtime`/`size` no longer match what was cached — which is every
 * file a sweep did not just write, still true after several re-reads of the
 * same account.
 *
 * A cache entry answers a `slim` request whether it was itself read slim or
 * whole (the bulky fields are simply unused), but never answers a `whole`
 * request from a `slim` entry — those fields are gone from it for good, so
 * that case reads the file again and upgrades the entry in place.
 *
 * One instance lives for one run and is never shared across runs or
 * processes — a fresh `ScanCache` is exactly as safe as passing none at all.
 * See `ops/sweep.ts`, which is the only caller that keeps one alive across
 * several scans.
 *
 * A cache hit hands back the exact same `card.data` object reference every
 * time (see `DiscoveredSession.data`'s own doc comment) — never a fresh
 * parse. The whole point is to skip the `JSON.parse`, so nothing here clones
 * it. That makes an in-place mutation of a cached card's `data` a bug that

/**
 * Rewrite a card's `lastActivityAt` to match its transcript, and nothing else.
 *
 * The app only stamps this field when it is itself hosting the
 * conversation, so work done through the CLI — in a `cwd` the card was never
 * opened from, say — advances the transcript while the card's own date sits
 * frozen at the moment it was created. The row then sinks in Recents and reads
 * as work that never arrived, which is the sweep's whole reputation on the
 * line for a gap homecoming did not cause.
 *
 * `continued.ts` already reads both sides of this for the narrower case of a
 * ledger-known fostering, but only ever to print a warning. `retitle.ts`
 * already rewrites one field of a card in place, native cards included, app
 * open, with an atomic write and a ledger event. This is that machinery a
 * third time, for a third field — see the module doc comment there for why
 * none of this needs a process guard: the write is idempotent, so a card the
 * app saves back from memory before the next restart is simply a card the
 * next plan finds again.
 *
 * The one property `retitleCards` did not need and this does: `lastActivityAt`
 * drives sidebar ORDER, so a wrong value here does not just read oddly, it
 * moves a row the user is looking for. That is why the writer here (`dateCards`)
 * takes an explicit target value rather than computing one from a transcript
 * itself — the same split `retitleCards`/`branchCards.ts` keep for titles — and
 * why the *planning* half (`planDates`) is the one place the "never backwards"
 * rule has to hold: it only ever proposes advancing a card whose transcript is
 * ahead of it, and reports the rest as left alone rather than silently dropped.

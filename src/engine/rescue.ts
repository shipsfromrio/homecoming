/**
 * Conversations stranded by a crash, and the resume that brings each one back.
 *
 * A session card with a remote-control mirror is a live link: the app shows the
 * conversation through the process hosting it. When that process dies without
 * closing — a crash, a reboot, a kill — the server keeps the mirror, the card
 * can only say "cannot reach your computer", and nothing client-side reattaches
 * the old mirror id. Verified against a live store after a crash: the device
 * key, bridge URL and authentication all survive unchanged, and the card stays
 * unreachable regardless — the link is per-session, not per-device.
 *
 * What works is resuming the conversation. The transcript on disk is complete,
 * `claude --resume` picks it up, and the first turn mints a fresh mirror; the
 * old card never reconnects and can be archived. The same goes for the empty
 * mirror cards named after the device ("no messages yet"): they are the other
 * side of the same husk, hold nothing, and are archived rather than rescued.

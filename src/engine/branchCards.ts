/**
 * One row per branch, and the rows say which one carried on.
 *
 * A fork is one piece of work on two or more transcripts, and the sweep used to
 * stop at it: the destination showed whichever half had reached it first, the
 * half that carried on was refused as "already has a branch", and merging was
 * left to `consolidate` — which refuses beyond a threshold, wants the app
 * closed, and hides every branch but one. Measured on a real store, the row the
 * user had pinned held 328 records while the branches in the other accounts
 * held 3157 and 2564, and every sweep reported that nothing was left to do.
 *
 * So the sweep gives every branch its own row instead, and hides nothing. The
 * branch that carried on — `branches[0]`, by the measure `branches.ts` defends
 * — keeps its title untouched. A row this account already holds on another
 * branch is marked the same way as a copy would be, native or not;
 * `retitle.ts` says why that write is safe with the app open.
 *
 * What the other branches wear depends on whether they stopped. A branch that
 * holds records of its own and went on after the tip did is not stale — it is
 * where the work was left, and on this store it was where two of the forks the
 * sweep could see had been left, 50 and 77 hours after the tip stopped.
 * It keeps its place in the sidebar and says which branch it is. Only a branch
 * that really did stop earlier is marked stale and filed in the archived view:
 * still there, still opens, no longer looking like the row to continue in.
 *
 * Nothing here decides between branches, which is what kept `consolidate` a
 * question for the user. Every branch keeps a row, so there is nothing to lose
 * and no threshold to set.

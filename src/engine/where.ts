/**
 * "Where is this conversation, and which row is the one to continue in?"
 *
 * The manual recipe this replaces was three separate measurements, run by hand
 * whenever a conversation "didn't come in the sweep": grep every account's
 * cards for the id or the title, read the transcript directory to see how many
 * files it occupies, and weigh those files against each other to guess which
 * row was still worth opening. All three questions have working answers
 * already — `Lineage`, `weighScans`, the ledger's own fold — this module only
 * puts them in front of one query instead of three ad-hoc reads.
 *
 * A conversation shown twice happens two different ways, and both are in
 * scope here, unlike `fileCards.ts` and `branchCards.ts`, which only ever see
 * one of them at a time because each runs inside a single account's sweep:
 *
 *  - the same `cliSessionId`, opened from two working directories, which
 *    leaves two *files* (`Lineage.reachOf`, `fileCards.ts`);
 *  - a fork, two different `cliSessionId`s sharing a root, each its own file
 *    (`Lineage.rootOf`, `branches.ts`, `branchCards.ts`).
 *
 * Both are decided by the same measure — records a row's file holds that no
 * sibling's does, weighed with `weighScans`, the shared engine both passes in
 * `src/engine/` already stand on — so this module ranks every row across the
 * whole family (every id sharing the conversation's root, every file any of
 * them opens) in one pass rather than choosing a file-election path or a
 * branch-election path up front.

 * `byContinuation` would otherwise fall through to comparing ids on a tied
 * file: the target account's own visible row first, then its archived row
 * — the target's own card, however filed, still beats a jump to another
 * account — then another account's visible row, then the rest. `target` is

/**
 * Releasing the worktree claim a copy inherited when it was written, before
 * `buildFosterCopy` learned to drop it (0.38.0). That fix only reaches a
 * copy being minted from here on; this handles what is already on
 * disk — measured at 807 copies naming a worktree, 109 of those directories
 * claimed by more than one live card.
 *
 * The write is the same one `buildFosterCopy` would have made at the time: the
 * three claim fields removed, `cwd` moved to `originCwd` when that is somewhere
 * else. Everything else on the card — its identity, its title, its dates,
 * whatever keys the app has added since — is carried through verbatim, the
 * discipline `repointCards` and `retitleCards` both keep.
 *
 * Only copies are ever candidates. `worktreeClaim` cannot tell a copy from a
 * card the app wrote — the fields look the same either way — so the ledger
 * decides instead: a candidate is one of the active fosterings it already
 * tracks, never a card discovered by scanning the store. A native card keeping
 * a stale claim is the first left-open follow-up, not this one's to touch.
 *
 * Neither write here takes a process guard — an idempotent repair, exactly like
 * `retitleCards`. The app reads the session directory once, at startup, and
 * holds everything it found in memory from then on; a card it is holding is one
 * it may write back, in full, the next time something about it changes. A
 * release that write overwrites is not lost: `planUnclaim` re-derives the claim
 * from whatever is on disk, so a copy the app hands the fields back to is simply
 * a copy the next plan finds again, and the next pass — or the next sweep —
 * releases it a second time. The change becomes visible at the app's next
 * restart either way, the same as a retitle. `repoint.ts` keeps the guard
 * because a pointer move racing the app's own write is a move that can be
 * silently lost with nothing left recording that it should happen again — the
 * ledger there says "moved", not "keep moving until it holds"; a claim release
 * has nothing of that kind to race.

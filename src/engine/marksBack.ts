/**
 * Marks the app undid while it was open, written again while it is closed.
 *
 * `retitle.ts` writes a card with the app running, on purpose, and says what it
 * costs: the app can save a card it holds in memory back over the write. Measured
 * 24/09/2026 on a real store: one sweep marked 49 rows "(second file, …)",
 * and within three minutes the running app had written 10 of them back under
 * their old titles — no foster event in between, and the run's own re-plan had
 * already passed, so it said nothing. The next sweep put 3 back, the one after
 * that the other 7. Three whole runs, for marks this run had already decided.
 *
 * So the gap that `homecoming layout --yes --restart` (and `sweep --restart`) opens
 * with the app closed puts them back, from the ledger alone: for every card of
 * this account in this store whose last recorded write is a retitle, a card that
 * now shows a title homecoming has seen it wear *before* that write is one the app
 * reverted, and gets the write again — the title, and the archived flag foster
 * last set on it. A card showing any other title was renamed by somebody and is
 * left alone, the rule every other pass here keeps. Written while the app is
 * down, it is what the app reads when it starts, so it holds.
 *
 * Only this store's cards: the ledger remembers every installation homecoming has
 * written into, and a second profile signed into the same account has an app of
 * its own that this gap never closed.
 *
 * The one reading this cannot tell apart: a row renamed by hand to exactly a
 * title it wore before. The sweep's own plan would mark that row again on its
 * next run just the same, so this is no bolder than the pass that wrote it.

/**

 * a card of this account, in this store, whose *last* archive write this
 * ledger recorded is an `archive_synced`, is written again when the disk now
 * shows the flag that write's own `from` carried — the value the app had
 * before that write, meaning the app has since saved the card back over it.
 *
 * Kept separate from `planMarksBack` rather than folded in: the two events
 * write disjoint fields (a title versus a bare flag) and disjoint files' worth
 * of history to track (`worn` titles have no equivalent boolean shape worth
 * building), and `card_retitled`'s own `toArchived` half is already covered
 * by `planMarksBack` when a mark carries one — this only ever needs to catch
 * up the other writer, `engine/archiveSync.ts`'s own event.
 *
 * Only the *last* archive-touching event per card is read: a `card_retitled`
 * written after this event lands is the newer intent, and revisiting a flag
 * `archive_synced` set before that would fight the more recent write instead
 * of catching up on it — that case is `planMarksBack`'s to answer, not this
 * one's.

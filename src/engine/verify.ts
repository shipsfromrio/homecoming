/**
 * Read back everything the ledger says homecoming wrote to one account, and say
 * what the app has since undone.
 *
 * The occasion is the gap `homecoming layout --yes --restart` and `sweep
 * --restart` open and close: they write while the app is down, and the app's
 * own startup can rewrite some of it straight back — measured 23/09/2026 and
 * 24/09/2026 on real stores, in two different ways. `marksBack.ts` and
 * `pinMoves.ts` each already answer "did this specific write stick?" from the
 * ledger alone, which is exactly what a command run well after the fact, in a
 * fresh process, can still ask; `layoutVerify.ts`'s own check cannot be
 * repeated here, because it rests on the `LayoutAssignment[]` a run planned in
 * memory and a `layout_applied` ledger event carries only counts (see the
 * comment on `LayoutAppliedEvent` — nothing reads its fields back on purpose).
 *
 * `planLayout` already composes `planMarksBack` and `planPinMoves` for
 * exactly this reason — `homecoming layout` calls it to decide what to write in
 * the gap — so reading its `.marks` and `.pins` back out is the whole of the
 * title/archived-flag and pin halves of this check, not a re-derivation.
 *
 * Groups and routines get a narrower, explicitly hedged check. Nothing in the
 * ledger says which card a past run put in which group, so "is this specific
 * assignment still there" cannot be answered after the fact the way a title
 * or a pin can. What can be told apart is the shape measured on 23/09/2026: a
 * scope that goes from N groups to zero while a fresh plan still wants to
 * create some — the account had layout applied to it before, and now shows
 * none of it. Anything short of that — a plan with pending assignments but a
 * non-empty scope — is reported as pending work, not asserted as undone,
 * because it cannot be told apart from other accounts simply having gained
 * new group assignments since the last run.

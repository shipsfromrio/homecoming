/**
 * Which half of a forked conversation is the one that carried on.
 *
 * `lineage.ts` answers whether two transcripts are the same work. This answers
 * the question that follows, and the only one that lets a fork be tidied up: of
 * the halves, which is the one to show — and what showing it stops showing.
 *
 * The measure is **records a branch holds that no sibling holds**. Two other
 * measures suggest themselves and both are wrong here, measured on a real store:
 *
 *  - **File `mtime`.** The app rewrites its own bookkeeping — `custom-title`,
 *    `mode`, `last-prompt` — every time a card is opened, so a transcript nobody
 *    has added a word to gets a fresh timestamp. One fork had its stale half
 *    stamped a day *after* the half that was still running, purely because
 *    somebody clicked the stale row. A rule that ranks by mtime can be flipped by
 *    looking at the wrong answer, which is the worst property a tie-break can
 *    have.
 *  - **The common prefix.** A branch is a copy of the history, so walking both
 *    files in step until they differ looks exact. It is not: the app does not
 *    write the copy in the original's order. On one fork the ordered prefix ran
 *    169 records while the two files had 1255 in common — an answer wrong by a
 *    factor of seven, in the direction of overstating what a branch holds alone.
 *
 * Set difference has neither failure. Ids survive the copy, order does not
 * matter, and bookkeeping records carry no `uuid` at all, so they cannot vote.

 * records nobody else has, the fatter one wins the ranking while the other may
 * be where the work was left an hour ago.
 *
 * A branch counts as diverged only when it holds records of its own *and* its

 *
 *  - a branch holding nothing the tip does not hold has nothing to go back

/**
 * Bring a card's archived flag into step with the account most recently
 * active on the same conversation.
 *
 * A sweep already brings a copy in with the flag its source wore *at the
 * moment it was copied* (`buildFosterCopy` — always unarchived, unless the
 * branch pass archived it on purpose, `FosteredEvent.archived`), and never
 * touches it again. So a conversation archived or reopened in the
 * previous account after it was copied stays out of step with the copy: the
 * sidebar reads as if the work had stopped, or as if it had not, depending on
 * which side you look from.
 *
 * "Most recently active" is the same `activityOf`/`byRecency` ordering the
 * rest of this codebase already reads a conversation's own freshness by
 * (`domain/filter.ts`), asked across every card sharing a `cliSessionId` —
 * copies and native cards alike, in every account but the target. Nothing
 * here rescans; it is handed the cards a sweep already read (see `runSweep`
 * passing cards to `planTitleSync` for the shape this follows).
 *
 * **Only a source that moved on after this row was last used here is ever
 * followed — for every row, copy or native, with or without a ledger
 * record.** `bestSource.lastActivityAt` has to be strictly greater than this
 * card's own `lastActivityAt`, or the row is left alone (`used-here-last`).
 * This is not an optimisation, it is the rule that keeps an on-purpose change
 * safe: archiving a session on purpose in the account it ran in gives that
 * account the higher activity, and leaves every
 * other account's card on the same conversation unarchived and — because
 * nothing has touched it since — older. A check that asked only "does homecoming
 * own this flag" and not "did the source actually move on" would still let
 * that older, untouched, unarchived card in another account undo the very
 * archive that was just made on purpose, the moment a sweep next ran into
 * the account holding it. A first version of this pass made exactly that
 * mistake for an old copy with no ledger record at all — trusting a "safe to
 * sync" default the moment the source disagreed, recency unchecked — and it
 * is why the check is now unconditional rather than only asked for a native
 * card.
 *
 * **Local change wins, once the recency gate above has already been
 * passed.** A target card whose current flag is not the one *homecoming itself*
 * last set is left alone (`changed-by-hand`) — read from the ledger, never
 * guessed from the strings on disk. `lastForsterArchiveWrite`
 * (`ledger/project.ts`) answers that for a card either of `archive_synced` or
 * a `card_retitled` carrying `toArchived` has touched before: whichever of
 * the two wrote last wins. A card neither writer has ever touched has no such
 * record, and is simply followed, once recency has already cleared it —
 * except a copy the branch pass archived on purpose
 * (`FosteredEvent.archived`/`ActiveFostering.archivedByFoster`), which is
 * that pass's own decision to own, the same as a title mark, and is left
 * alone here (`foster-marked`) rather than second-guessed.
 *
 * **A tie in recency settles nothing.** Two cards can carry the identical
 * `lastActivityAt` — a spawned or never-opened card in particular, whose
 * activity is whatever placeholder timestamp it was seeded with rather than a
 * real moment — and when the tied cards disagree on the flag, picking one
 * over the other would be an arbitrary array-order accident, not a read of
 * which account was really more recent. Such a card is left alone rather than
 * guessed at.
 *
 * **Marks are never touched.** A title carrying a mark this ledger has ever
 * seen foster write (`templatesSeen`, the same set `titleSync.ts` reads) is
 * the branch or second-file pass's own row, and neither the archived flag it
 * was filed under nor its tip counterpart is this pass's to move — see
 * `markedThisRound` for the same-run half of that rule, needed because a row
 * this very sweep round just marked has no `card_retitled` in the ledger yet
 * for `lastForsterArchiveWrite` to have read.

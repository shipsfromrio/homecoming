/**
 * Two rows in one sidebar for one conversation.
 *
 * A conversation belongs to no account: it is a transcript on disk that any
 * account can hold a card for. So an account can have its own card for a
 * conversation *and* receive a fostered copy of another account's card for the
 * same one — same work, two rows, different dates, no hint in the sidebar that
 * they are the same thing.
 *
 * The same row appears for a *branch* too, and by the same route: the app forks a
 * conversation that has a live writer, the fork gets an id nothing has seen, and
 * the two halves of one piece of work are fostered from two accounts as if they
 * were unrelated.
 *
 * Fostering now refuses to add the second row. This is for the ones already
 * there, and it draws a line that matters: homecoming removes only what homecoming wrote.
 * A conversation with two cards the app itself made is reported and left alone —
 * deleting somebody else's file on the strength of a heuristic is exactly the
 * kind of help nobody asked for.

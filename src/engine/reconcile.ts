/**
 * What became of a copy the ledger still counts as active.
 *
 * The ledger is the record of what homecoming did, not a claim about what is on disk
 * now: a copy can be deleted in the app, which homecoming never hears about. Left
 * unexamined that turns into a dead end — fostering the same session again is
 * skipped as "already fostered" while nothing is there, and the tool looks
 * broken.
 *
 * Three answers matter and they are genuinely different:
 *
 *  - **deleted in the app.** The app leaves a `deleted_<id>` marker with the time,
 *    so this is not an inference: the user threw that copy away on purpose. Making
 *    a bulk run resurrect it would undo a decision they made deliberately.
 *  - **gone.** No marker, and the directory that should hold it lists without it.
 *    Nobody deleted it through the app: a crash between the unlink and the ledger
 *    append during a return, or a file removed by hand. Recreating it is what was
 *    asked for.
 *  - **unreachable.** The directory does not list at all. Copies can live in
 *    another installation — a profile on a removable drive, a folder that is not
 *    mounted — and "the file is not there" then means "not right now". Concluding
 *    anything would produce a second copy the moment the drive came back.
 *  - **repurposed.** The file is there and no longer holds the conversation it was
 *    made for. Opening a copy of a conversation that is live elsewhere makes the
 *    app branch rather than continue it: it writes a new transcript and repoints
 *    the card at the branch. The copy is then a perfectly good card for a
 *    different conversation, and the one it was fostered for has no card here at
 *    all — while the ledger, which only knows a file was written, keeps answering
 *    "already fostered" and refuses to bring it again. Measured on a real store:
 *    a copy made at 06:30 for one conversation pointed at a branch born at 09:55.

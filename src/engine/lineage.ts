   * later round's new ids are searched against every transcript any earlier
   * round already knows the head of, not only against each other, and every

   * back, and a round that hands back exactly one new id used to compare it
   * against nothing at all: a card the app creates between rounds never got
   * weighed against the conversations already indexed.
   *
   * "Searched against every transcript any earlier round already knows the
   * head of" reads a file, not a whole transcript, so it is bounded by a
   * cache rather than by round count: a file is read and pattern-matched at
   * most once for the life of this `Lineage`, whichever round is the first

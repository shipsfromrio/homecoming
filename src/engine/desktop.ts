 * the user to do it by hand was never the interesting part of the job, so homecoming
 * does it — with two hard rules:
 *
 *  - it never closes an app it is running inside, because the Code session
 *    driving homecoming is a child of that app and would be killed mid-write;
 *  - it asks the app to quit rather than terminating it, so the app runs its own
 *    shutdown (flushing pending session writes, warning about work in progress).
 *    Terminating is available, but only as an explicit escalation.
 */

/**
 * Both the desktop app and the Code CLI it spawns are called claude.exe. Only
 * the path tells them apart, and only the CLI lives under a claude-code
 * directory. The separation itself lives in util/processes: the session registry
 * asks the same question of a pid, and must not import desktop control to do it.
 *
 * A row whose path could not be read is *not* the app. That is the whole point:
 * the path is the only evidence, so without it "not a CLI" is an absence rather
 * than a finding — and a claude.exe launched by another tool, or by a user whose
 * processes this one cannot read, arrives here looking exactly like the app.
 * Treating it as the app put a stranger's pid in front of `taskkill /F /T`, which
 * killed it and left the real app running to report "still running". Requiring
 * proof costs at most a manual restart when the app's own path is unreadable;
 * the other way round ends someone else's process.
 *
 * "Not the CLI" alone is not enough, either. A standalone `claude.exe` — a
 * `~/.local/bin/claude.exe` run from a terminal, never installed as the app at
 * all — is not under `\claude-code\` and so passed every check above, which is
 * exactly the failure this function exists to close: with the app closed, a
 * machine carrying a dozen such CLIs turned every one of them into an orphaned
 * `desktop` row, and the tie-break in `inspectDesktop` handed `taskkill /F /T`
 * whichever was oldest. So absence of proof that a row is the CLI no longer
 * qualifies it; presence of proof that it is the app does. Two are cheap and
 * available without spawning anything new: its path sits under a store root
 * this environment already knows about (`candidateStoreRoots`, or either of the
 * MSIX package's own directories — a fresh install without a
 * `claude-code-sessions` folder yet still lives under `\Packages\Claude...`, and
 * the executable itself under `\WindowsApps\Claude_...`), or it has at least one
 * child carrying `--type=`, which only Electron's own helpers ever do. Without
 * either, the row is a stranger and stays out of `DesktopState` — same rule
 * `util/processes.ts` already argues in prose for the CLI side of this line.

 * executable with identity but pointed at different arguments — and only
 * falls back to running the executable directly when that cmdlet is missing

 * --terminate` and reopened by a plain launch (no package identity) came back
 * signed in but with its window hidden (`MainWindowHandle` 0) — the "closed to
 * tray" state carried across the restart. Waiting longer never raised it; a
 * *second* launch with the same `--user-data-dir` did, by forwarding to the
 * instance's own single-instance lock. So once a profile's lockfile is held,
 * this gives its window up to `windowCheckTimeoutMs` to appear and, if it has
 * not, launches it once more the same way to raise it — see
 * `mainWindowVisible` in util/processes.ts.

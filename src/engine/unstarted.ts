 * start-up — the chip leaves a card behind that looks like every other card in
 * the sidebar, and the request inside it is simply gone. There is no
 * conversation to resume, so `rescue` is the wrong instrument: what is
 * recoverable is the prompt, and the only place it survives is the first user
 * record of the transcript.
 *
 * Such requests are rare and invisible without looking: the card is there, the
 * answer never was.
 *
 * What this does NOT do is re-run them. A lost request can be weeks old and
 * name work long since finished by other means; relaunching it automatically
 * would redo dead requests and risk duplicating work already done. The list is
 * the product, and the decision stays with the reader.

/**
 * `homecoming grep`: a regex over every transcript this machine holds — every
 * client's `projects/` tree, every conversation any account ever ran —
 * searched by what a `user`/`assistant` message actually says rather than by
 * the JSONL a record happens to be written as.
 *
 * Two passes per file, coarse then real, the same shape `idsMentionedIn`
 * (`store/transcripts.ts`) already reads a transcript in for lineage: latin1,
 * byte-for-byte, because the structure of a JSON line and its ASCII survive
 * that decode and a rare term almost never does. What is new here is *how*
 * coarse the first pass is. `idsMentionedIn` still walks the whole file with
 * `matchAll`, because it is genuinely after every occurrence of several ids at
 * once; a `grep` for one rare term needs only one question answered — does
 * this file hold it at all? — and asking that of the *whole file's text in one
 * call*, before ever splitting it into lines, is what a plain `String#includes`
 * (or, for a pattern that carries real regex syntax, one `RegExp#test`, which
 * stops at its first hit rather than collecting every one) is fast at. A
 * transcript that fails it is never parsed, never even split into lines — which
 * is what most of a large corpus does, for a rare term.
 *
 * The real match is asked only of a line the coarse pass flagged, and only of
 * the *decoded* text a message actually shows — never of the raw JSONL, which
 * would as happily match a `\n` inside a JSON escape or a `uuid` quoted inside
 * a tool result as it would a word someone wrote. `Buffer.from(line,
 * 'latin1').toString('utf8')` is what recovers the real characters: the latin1
 * read never changed a byte, so writing those char codes back out as bytes and
 * decoding *that* as UTF-8 reconstructs exactly what was on disk, not a guess —
 * the same round trip `recordFields`' comments describe for the three fields it
 * reads, extended here to a whole line because a search needs the message
 * body, not three short strings.

 * cheap and calling it thousands of times is not worth avoiding by itself, but
 * threading the already-decided answer through is free.
 *
 * The file is read as a `Buffer` first, and the *literal* coarse check —
 * `Buffer#includes` on the raw bytes — runs against that, never against a
 * decoded string. Measured 24/09/2026 over a real corpus, 11202 files, 13.6
 * GB: `readFileSync(file, 'latin1')`, which allocates a JS string the length
 * of every byte, cost 30 s end to end for an absent term; reading the same
 * files as `Buffer`s and only decoding the ones `Buffer#includes` flags cut
 * that to under 15 s, most of it the bare cost of reading 13.6 GB off disk at
 * all (measured separately at ~10.6 s). A pattern carrying real regex syntax
 * still needs a string to run `RegExp#test` against, so that path decodes
 * every file regardless — the literal path is what a plain search term gets.
 *
 * `literal` is already the *JSON-escaped* form of the search term — see
 * `jsonEscapeLiteral` — so the coarse check above compares against what the
 * file actually holds on disk, not against the term as somebody typed it.
 *
 * `forceFullScan` covers what the literal path's escaping cannot: a regex
 * pattern whose *source* contains a quote, a backslash or a control
 * character has no safe general rewrite (a `\` in a regex source can start
 * an escape for a literal character, a character class, a backreference or a
 * Unicode property, and only the first of those maps onto a single disk byte
 * sequence) — see the blocker this fixes for two real patterns that failed
 * silently on a real corpus. Rather than risk a second silent miss, such a
 * pattern skips both coarse checks below and decodes every line of every
 * file instead, exactly as if nothing had been coarse-filtered — slower for
 * that one query, never wrong.

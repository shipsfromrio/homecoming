/**
 * Rewrite what a card is called, and whether it is filed away — nothing else.
 *
 * The sweep gives every branch of a fork a row, and this is how the rows that
 * did not carry on come to say so: the title gains a mark, the card moves to the
 * archived view. Which conversation the row opens is never touched here; that is
 * `repoint.ts`, and a different kind of write.
 *
 * Different enough that this one takes no process guard. `safety.ts` asks whether
 * the running app will write the card back from memory, and refuses every native
 * card while the app is up — right for a pointer, where a lost write is silent
 * and `--undo` would then reverse a move the app had already reversed. A lost
 * title costs a mark the next sweep puts back: the plan is computed from what is
 * on disk, so it is idempotent by construction, and a sweep ends with the restart
 * that makes the app read the disk again, after which the app's memory holds
 * what was written here. Refusing would leave exactly the card this exists for —
 * the stale native row in the signed-in account — saying the wrong thing.
 *
 * What stands in for the guard: the write is atomic, so the app can never read
 * a torn file; every other key is carried through verbatim, the discipline
 * `repointCards` keeps; nothing is written when nothing would change; and the
 * write is recorded before and after, so the log can put it back.

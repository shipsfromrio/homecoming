/**
 * Bring a copy's title back into step with the original's.
 *
 * A copy carries the title of the instant it was made, and every later sweep
 * sees it as already fostered and walks past. So a conversation renamed in the
 * account it came from keeps the old name in every other account for ever
 * — the sidebar reads as if the work were missing, when only its name is.
 * Nothing about the mechanics was in the way: `retitle.ts` has rewritten titles
 * with the app open since 0.37.0. The step was missing, not the ability.
 *
 * Three decisions hold this together, and all three come from the ledger rather
 * than from reading strings.
 *
 * **Whose title wins.** A copy still wearing the last title homecoming itself wrote
 * is rewritten: that is `card_retitled.to` when homecoming has marked the card
 * since, and the fostering's `originalTitle` otherwise. A copy the user renamed
 * by hand matches neither and is left alone — measured on a real store, 875 of
 * 911 copies still matched, 9 wore a mark, and the single hand-renamed one was
 * exactly the row that must not be trampled.
 *
 * That test alone is too narrow, though, and the gap is not rare. Open a copy in
 * this account and the app generates a title for it, which matches no baseline —
 * so a conversation renamed where it came from stayed out of step for ever, and
 * a sweep reported it as "renamed here" when nobody had renamed anything. The
 * card records who named it (`titleSource`, see `namerOf`), so the second rule
 * is authorship: a name a person chose beats a name the app generated, and a
 * name chosen on both sides is settled only where it can be proved.
 *
 * **Which rename is newer**, where both were chosen. No clock answers it: there
 * is no `titleUpdatedAt`, and `lastActivityAt` moves when a conversation is
 * merely opened. `previousTitles` does — the names a card used to wear. A side
 * whose history already holds the name the other side is wearing has been
 * through it and gone on, which orders the two without dating either. Both
 * histories through the other's name, or neither, is a real tie and stays a
 * reported conflict.
 *
 * **Marks are kept, and never copied.** The mark a branch wears is not part of
 * its name, so it survives the rewrite; and a mark the *origin* happens to wear
 * is not carried over, or the two would stack. The mark comes from `markedTo`,
 * the title left by the last write that could make one — never from subtracting
 * anything out of the latest title, which reads a sync's own work as a mark and
 * writes it in front again on the next run. Where the ledger names no such write
 * — a mark made under another card's id, or reworded since — the words themselves
 * answer instead: every template this log proves homecoming used, plus the ones this
 * run was told to write, which are not in the log yet.
 *
 * **Cards are paired by card, never by conversation.** A title lives on a card;
 * one conversation becomes a card per account and another per branch. The ledger
 * already records which card was copied from which, and on the same store 85
 * fosterings carry no `cliSessionId` at all — pairing on the transcript would
 * silently drop them.
 *
 * Only the title crosses. `card_retitled` carries the archived flag too, and
 * following that as well would make this state sync: whether a branch belongs in
 * the archived view is the sweep's own decision, taken per branch, and not this
 * pass's to overrule.

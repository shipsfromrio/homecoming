/**
 * Destroy the conversations behind deleted sessions.
 *
 * Every other operation in homecoming adds a file or removes one it wrote itself,
 * and the ledger exists so any of them can be walked backwards. This one cannot
 * be walked backwards. It deletes the transcript — the conversation itself,
 * every word of it — and there is no copy anywhere, by design: a command whose
 * purpose is to make something unrecoverable cannot quietly keep a backup and
 * still be that command.
 *
 * Which is why the interesting part of this module is what it refuses. The
 * caller supplies a candidate set that is already narrowed to conversations no
 * session anywhere points at (see `findPurgeable`); the gate here is the other
 * one — a live `claude` process holding the file open. Deleting underneath a
 * running writer is how a process ends up appending to a file that no longer has
 * a name, which loses the work in progress and leaves nothing to show for it.

/**
 * The second gate, and the reason it counts rather than merely asks.

 * it is enough: what they do can be undone by the command sitting next to them.
 * Accepting the same flag here would put "destroy every conversation I ever
 * threw away" one word away from "copy them into my sidebar" — the same word,
 * in the same shell history.
 *
 * A count is a better second gate than another flag or a typed phrase, because
 * it is the only one that can fail for a reason other than intent. It cannot be
 * pasted out of documentation or typed from muscle memory; it has to be read off
 * a dry run. And if the set moved between looking and acting — something else
 * deleted in the app in the meantime, a filter that matches more than it did —
 * the number no longer agrees and the run stops, instead of destroying a
 * conversation that was never on the list the user actually read.

/**
 * Restarting Claude Desktop from a session the app itself hosts.
 *
 * `restartPlan` (`src/ops/sweep.ts`) refuses this outright — quitting the app
 * kills the Code session part-way through, foster included — and hands over a
 * command for a terminal outside it. That refusal is correct and stays; this is
 * the escape hatch for someone who is *only* ever inside a hosted session and
 * still wants "one command finishes the job".
 *
 * Measured end to end on the real machine (22/09/2026):
 *
 *  1. `Invoke-CimMethod -ClassName Win32_Process -MethodName Create -Arguments
 *     @{CommandLine='wscript.exe "<vbs>"'}` — the new process's parent is
 *     `WmiPrvSE.exe`, outside the app's tree and outside its MSIX container, so
 *     it survives the app quitting and `restartPlan` sees no app ancestor in it.
 *  2. The `.vbs` runs a `cmd.exe /c "ping … & echo … & node "<homecoming.js>" …
 *     & echo …"` line through `WScript.Shell.Run(cmd, 0, True)` — window style
 *     0 is what actually hides it; on this machine Windows Terminal is the
 *     default terminal and a console process pops a window even with
 *     `-WindowStyle Hidden`, `Run(…, 0, …)` does not.
 *  3. Result: the app quits, the write lands in the gap, the app starts again,
 *     the log is complete. The launching session dies with the app — expected,
 *     and said plainly by the CLI before it ever launches this.
 *
 * Pitfall measured writing the `.vbs` generator itself: `Log` is a VBScript
 * built-in function, and a variable named `Log` kills the script with an error
 * dialog before anything runs. None of the names this module writes may collide
 * with a VBScript built-in (`Log`, `Date`, `Time`, `Len`, …) — `vbsAssignsBuiltin`
 * exists so a test can hold that promise rather than trusting it by inspection.

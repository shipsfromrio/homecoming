/**
 * One conversation, two rows, and the rows say which one to continue in.
 *
 * This is the sibling of `branchCards.ts`, for the case that is not a fork. A
 * `cliSessionId` names a conversation, not a file: the app opens the transcript
 * under the project directory for the card's own working directory, so
 * continuing one conversation from a repository and from a worktree cut out of
 * it leaves two files under one id, each holding what was written while its own
 * card was in use. The sweep brings both rows on purpose — each opens records
 * the other cannot (`executor.ts`) — and until now they arrived wearing the
 * same title, with nothing to say which was which.
 *
 * Measured on a real store (19/09/2026, 1272 copies into one account): 12 such
 * pairs with both rows in the sidebar. The repository's file was the fuller one
 * in 7 and the worktree's in 5, so no rule of thumb about which side wins; 4
 * pairs had a second row that opened no file at all; and the app archived the
 * loser by itself in 10 of the 12 — but only after one of the rows was used,
 * which is exactly the choice the reader was making blind.
 *
 * So this pass makes the choice and says so. **The row to continue in is the one
 * whose last answer is the most recent** — where the work was left — and it keeps
 * its title, coming back out of the archived view if homecoming is what filed it.
 * Every other row of that conversation wears a dated mark and is filed away:
 * still there, still opens, no longer competing for the click. Nothing is merged
 * and no transcript is rewritten; the two files stay two files.
 *
 * What it refuses to touch is as deliberate as what it marks. A row opening the
 * *same* file as the row to continue in is not this pass's business — that is a
 * duplicate, a different problem. A conversation whose rows all open nothing has
 * no measurable answer, so it is left alone rather than guessed at. And a live
 * `claude` writing the conversation stops the write, the way every other pass
 * treats a conversation with a writer in it.

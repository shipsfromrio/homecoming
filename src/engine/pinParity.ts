/**
 * Cross-account pin parity — the target account (signed in) ends up with the
 * same pins the most recently active *other* account already has.
 *
 * Measured 26/09/2026: the pin list (`store/pinstate.ts`) is one list per
 * Desktop installation, holding card ids from every account at once — a card
 * a copy is minted under has a fresh id, so a copy of a pinned conversation
 * always arrives unpinned however carefully it is fostered. Bringing the pin
 * itself across is therefore its own pass, run in the same closed-app gap
 * `engine/pinMoves.ts` already writes in, against the same IndexedDB.
 *
 * Per conversation (`cliSessionId`, case-insensitive):
 *
 * - the **source** is the card for that conversation in whichever *other*
 *   account has the latest `lastActivityAt` among all of them — mirroring the
 *   "most recently active wins" rule `engine/layout.ts` already uses for
 *   groups and `engine/view.ts` for the filter menu;
 * - `desiredPinned` is whether the source's own card id is in the pin list;
 * - the **target row** is the row to continue in — `resolveContinuingCard`,
 *   the same choice `planGroups` makes (not archived, a clean title, then the
 *   latest activity) — so a pin never lands on an archived row.
 *
 * Local change wins: a pin is added when desired and not already there, but
 * an unwanted pin is removed only when it is one homecoming itself pinned before
 * (recorded in a `pins_synced` event) — never a pin the user set by hand,
 * here or anywhere else.

/**
 * When a running Claude Desktop matters, and when it does not.
 *
 * The app reads the session directory once, when it initialises its session
 * store, and holds everything it found in memory from then on. Two consequences
 * decide this whole module:
 *
 *  - **Adding** a copy is safe while the app runs. The copy carries a session id
 *    the app has never seen, so nothing in memory maps to that file: the app will
 *    not read it (it is past its one read) and will not write it (it only writes
 *    sessions it holds). It simply will not appear until the app initialises
 *    again.
 *  - **Removing** a copy is only safe if the app never loaded it. A copy the app
 *    holds in memory is one it may write back at any time — on a title change, on
 *    a focus timestamp — which would recreate the file homecoming just deleted.
 *
 * So fostering no longer demands a closed app, and returning demands it only for
 * the copies the app could be holding.

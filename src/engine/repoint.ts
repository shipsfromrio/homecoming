 * does not touch is as much the point as what it does. One field decides which
 * conversation a row opens; everything else on the card — its identity, its
 * title, its dates, whatever keys the app has added since — is carried through
 * verbatim, the same discipline `buildFosterCopy` follows for a copy.
 *
 * It is also the app's own move. A conversation that cannot be continued from a
 * second card is forked by the app, which writes a new transcript and repoints
 * the card at it (`continued.ts`). homecoming is not inventing an operation here; it
 * is performing the one the app performs, in the direction the app never offers.

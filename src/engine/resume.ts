 * `claude -p --resume` with the prompt on stdin.
 *
 * stdin on purpose: on Windows the command resolves through a shell (the CLI is
 * a .cmd shim, which Node refuses to spawn directly), and a prompt has no
 * business being interpreted by one. The only argv values are literals and an
 * id validated to [0-9a-f-].
 *
 * Async `spawn`, not `execFileSync`, and the difference is the point. Measured:
 * `execFileSync`'s own `timeout` sends its kill signal to the one pid it started
 * directly — on Windows, with `shell: true`, that pid is `cmd.exe`. A `.cmd`
 * shim needs a shell to resolve at all, but `cmd.exe` does not forward a signal
 * to whatever *it* went on to start; killing it leaves that child — here, the
 * real `claude` process — running and still appending to the transcript. The
 * caller believes the run is over and a second writer is now on the same file.
 * `spawn` plus a timer this function owns fixes that: on timeout it runs
 * `taskkill /PID <pid> /T /F` against the pid `spawn()` itself returned (the
 * shell), and `/T` walks down to every process that shell started — `claude`
 * included. The env is `scrubbedEnv` of `process.env`, for the same reason
 * every other launch in this codebase uses it: a `claude` started from inside
 * a hosted session must not come up thinking it is hosted too
 * (`launchEnv.ts`). `scrubbedEnv` strips everything starting with `CLAUDE`,
 * case-insensitively — including `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` — so `configDir` (read
 * by the caller from the same env `sessionRegistryRoots` used for the
 * live-writer check, before the scrub) is put back explicitly: that is the
 * only thing standing between this spawn and the operator's own `~/.claude`,
 * whenever a terminal was started with `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` pointed elsewhere.

 * `child.pid` already names the real `claude` process directly — no shell,
 * no tree to walk — and `process.kill` with `SIGKILL` reaches it the same

 * tell the rows apart but a date — and the row that looks most recent is often
 * the one that stopped.
 *
 * This plans the tidy-up: keep one card per account per piece of work, pointed
 * at the branch that holds the most that no sibling holds.
 *
 * What it will not do is pretend the halves can be added together. Choosing a
 * branch hides what the others hold alone, from the sidebar and only from the
 * sidebar — the transcripts stay on disk and `homecoming transcript` still reads
 * them. When both halves are substantial that trade is not worth making
 * silently, so the fork is reported with its numbers and left exactly as it is.
 * Merging transcripts would be the alternative, and rewriting the record of a

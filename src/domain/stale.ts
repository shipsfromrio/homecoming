 * was the whole complaint: the row somebody had pinned was the one that stopped
 * a day earlier, and nothing in the sidebar said so.
 *
 * So the branch that carried on keeps its title untouched, and every other
 * branch wears a mark in front of its own, carrying the moment its last answer
 * was written — the one fact that tells a reader "this is where it was left".
 * The mark is a template, because the words are the user's to choose and the

 * its own that the tip never got, one 50 hours ahead of it and the other 77.
 * Calling those "stale, stopped ..." and filing them in the archived view sent

 * (Counting every transcript on the disk the shape appears in 111 of 209
 * conversations, but most of those are CLI sessions with no card anywhere, and
 * a branch nobody holds a card for is not a row this ever decides about.)
 * Ranking by sheer recency instead would be worse: one trivial turn on an
 * abandoned half would promote it over a branch holding a thousand records
 * nobody else has.
 *
 * So neither half is called stale. The tip is still the branch holding most
 * work of its own, and a branch that went on after it keeps its place in the

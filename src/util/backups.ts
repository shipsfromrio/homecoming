/**
 * Where a write-with-app-closed command copies a file or a directory before
 * touching it — outside the Claude Desktop store entirely, the same place
 * `defaultLedgerPath` keeps the ledger, and relocatable the same way
 * (`FOSTER_HOME`).
 *
 * Earlier code put each backup next to the file it copied
 * (`<file>.bak-<second-resolution stamp>`), which sat inside the app's own
 * store and — worse — let two writes in the same run collide on one name: a
 * layout run that touches `claude_desktop_config.json` twice (once for groups,
 * once for the view-menu carry) took its second "backup" of the file the first
 * write had already changed, silently discarding the true original. Every
 * backup here gets its own name — a run-scoped timestamp directory plus a kind
 * label plus the writing process's pid plus a process-lifetime counter — so no
 * two calls, however close together, ever share a path.
 *
 * The pid alone does not finish the job: the timestamp directory
 * (second-resolution) is itself built from `now`, and a clock that has not
 * ticked yet is exactly the case that used to bite (bug measured 22/09/2026 —
 * a detached `homecoming layout --restart` and the in-app process it was
 * restarting around, both writing backups within the same second). `backupFile`
 * asks for the name `COPYFILE_EXCL`-only, so a name reused anyway — a clock
 * that jumped backwards, or a `now()` fixture two callers happen to share in a
 * test — fails loudly instead of quietly overwriting the earlier backup, and
 * is retried up to five times under a new suffix rather than left to throw.

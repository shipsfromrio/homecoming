 * the app's main process from its dozen helpers, and what tells foster whether
 * it is itself running inside the app. Windows PowerShell 5.1 ships with every
 * supported Windows, so this needs nothing installed.
 *
 * But PowerShell can also hang at start-up rather than fail quickly. Measured
 * on 05/09/2026: a machine whose PowerShell was blocked in
 * `InitializeDefaultDrives` of the FileSystem provider, waiting on a
 * WinFsp/Cryptomator drive that had stopped answering — every invocation, from
 * any script, waited the full 20 s and then errored, and this function
 * returning `[]` on that failure told every caller the machine had nothing
 * running at all. `homecoming app status`, `homecoming live`, `homecoming stores` and
 * `homecoming doctor` each paid the 20 s once per read and then reported a
 * confidently wrong answer — dangerous for `live --stop`, which decides what to
 * kill from exactly this table.
 *
 * So this now falls back, in `readProcessesWith`: when PowerShell fails or
 * returns nothing, `wmic process get ... /format:list` reports the same six
 * fields (see `parseWmicList` for its considerable list of quirks); when wmic
 * also fails or is not installed (it is a Feature on Demand on Windows 11 24H2
 * and later, and can be absent), `tasklist /fo csv /nh` reports pid and name
 * only, flagged `partial: true` (`parseTasklistCsv`) — a name is proof of
 * absence but never of identity, so every consumer that reasons from a path, a
 * parent link or a command line has to answer "cannot tell" rather than "no"
 * when it sees one. A PowerShell that fails once is not retried for the rest of
 * the process (`ReaderMemory.skipPowerShell`, sticky by design): a single CLI
 * run reads this table several times, `cachedProcesses` below only covers five
 * seconds of them, and paying the 20 s hang once per run instead of once per
 * read is most of the fix. `processTableProvenance()` reports which reader
 * actually answered the most recent read and why the ones before it were
 * passed over; `homecoming doctor` prints it.

 *    Unicode decoder, which has no cp850 table at all. ASCII bytes are exact

 *    contains non-ASCII characters — the ASCII markers foster actually greps
 *    for (`\claude-code\`, `\Packages\Claude`, `--user-data-dir=`, `--type=`)
 *    still match.
 *  - line endings are `\r\r\n`, the doubled CR wmic is known for; stripped
 *    below rather than split on, so a stray lone `\r` cannot swallow a line.
 *  - a `CommandLine` can itself contain `=` and commas (`--flag=a,b`), and
 *    `/format:list` does not escape or quote anything — so a line is only a new
 *    field when the text before its first `=` is one of the six keys asked
 *    for; anything else is the previous field's value continuing onto another
 *    line, and is appended to it rather than parsed as a key of its own.
 *  - a value can be empty (`ExecutablePath=` for a process whose path could not
 *    be read, `CommandLine=` likewise) — kept as `''`, not treated as absent.
 *
 * `CreationDate` is WMI's DMTF format, local time plus a UTC offset in minutes
 * (`yyyyMMddHHmmss.ffffff±ooo`); converted below by treating the local fields as
 * if they were UTC and then subtracting the offset. Verified against a live
 * process on the machine this was written for:

 * `processPackageIdentity` above) came back signed in, but hidden:
 * `window_visible_ms` was never observed and `MainWindowHandle` was `0`, the

 * with the same `--user-data-dir` — second-instance forwarding finding the
 * lock the first launch created — is what actually raised the window; waiting
 * longer on the first launch never did. `startDesktop` uses this to decide
 * whether that second nudge is needed.
 *
 * `undefined` means this could not be established (no working PowerShell, the
 * pid already gone) — never a guess, exactly like `processPackageIdentity`.
 *
 * `memory` shares the default with `processPackageIdentity` — see that
 * function's own doc comment for why sharing it matters here specifically:
 * `startDesktop` polls this in a loop.

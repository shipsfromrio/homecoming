/**
 * The whole job, in one call: everything that can be in this account's sidebar,
 * is.
 *
 * The request behind it never varies — "bring it all here, archived and deleted
 * included" — and answering it used to take three commands in the right order
 * plus knowledge that lived in no executable place. `--archived` is the piece
 * that was invisible: measured on one real store, the same sweep offered 15
 * sessions without it and 141 with it, so anyone who did not know the flag
 * finished with a tenth of the work done and no way to tell.
 *
 * Three passes, in this order, then a re-plan that proves they are exhausted:
 *
 *  1. copy every session that can move from the accounts you are leaving,
 *     once, archived included — the copy keeps the flag, so it lands in the
 *     destination's archived view rather than quietly reappearing in Recents;
 *  2. give every branch of a forked conversation a row of its own: the branch
 *     that carried on keeps its title, the rest are marked stale and filed in
 *     the archived view — see `branchCards.ts`;
 *  3. bring back conversations the app deleted that nothing still points at;
 *  4. release the worktree claim a copy already on disk inherited from its
 *     original, before `buildFosterCopy` learned not to hand one out — see `engine/unclaim.ts`. A copy fighting the original over a
 *     branch is a copy the app drops into the main repository, uncommitted
 *     work and all, which is not a session the user can use.
 *
 * Order matters. A conversation a fresh copy now points at is not lost any more,
 * so restoring after fostering asks the third question against the answer to
 * the first rather than against the state before it; and a fork's members are
 * kept out of the first pass so each row is written once, with its final title.
 * The worktree pass runs last, after the ledger holds every fostering the run
 * itself just wrote — not that a fresh copy would ever need it, since
 * `buildFosterCopy` already drops the claim at the point of copying, but so
 * the pass sees the same, settled state of this account's own directory the
 * final report describes.
 *
 * Right after the branch pass, a pin check follows through on what it just
 * wrote: pinning lives in the app's own IndexedDB, keyed on session id
 * (`store/pinstate.ts`), so a row the branch pass just marked stale keeps
 * whatever pin it had and the branch that carried on arrives unpinned. The
 * check always reads — one LevelDB read, which the app usually refuses (see
 * open — and only writes when the store allows it, degrading to a message in
 * `report.pinFixes` otherwise.
 *
 * What is deliberately *not* here: `purge`, which destroys transcripts and is
 * part of no sweep. `consolidate` is not either, but for the opposite reason —
 * with a row per branch nothing is hidden, so collapsing a fork to one row is a
 * tidy-up for whoever wants one, not a decision the sweep has to leave open.
 *
 * One scan, one lineage, one transcript index for the whole run. The passes
 * used to build their own, and a `--yes` run read every card in the store five
 * times over and walked the transcript tree six.

/**
 * The pin pass: say which pinned rows the branch pass just marked stale, and
 * move the pin onto the branch that carried on when the store allows it — see.
 *
 * Reading the pin list is one LevelDB read, the same one `homecoming pin` makes to
 * list what is pinned, and it is attempted on every sweep, dry run included.
 *
 * It used to fail almost always, with `MANIFEST-000001 names the log 000000.log,
 * which is not there` — and the app being open was never the cause, however well
 * the two correlated. Measured 21/09/2026: Chromium opens these databases reusing
 * the log it recovers, and only appends a version edit naming a log when it has
 * another reason to write one, so a manifest can say `log 0` for the life of the
 * database while the log on disk is `000003.log`. The number is a floor for
 * recovery, not an address, and `locate` now reads the newest log at or above it.
 *
 * That is also why copying never helped, which a later measurement
 * settled: a copy inherits the same manifest and fails identically. Renaming the
 * log inside the copy got the reader open, which is how the far older defect
 * underneath was found — and, in hindsight, how close the diagnosis came
 * to the real one.
 *
 * What changed is the silence. A failed read used to be indistinguishable from
 * "nothing is pinned", so a run that marked a pinned row stale said nothing and
 * left the pin sitting on the archived row. Now the failure is carried out as
 * `unreadable` and the summary says the check could not run — but only when this
 * run marked something, because with no stale mark there is no pin that could
 * have been left behind.
 *
 * Writing is not safe with the app open either, and is skipped rather than
 * failing the run: a pin that could not be moved is a line in the summary,
 * never a reason the sweep errors out.

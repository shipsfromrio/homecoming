/**
 * Ending the processes that hold conversations open.
 *
 * The only way to release a conversation from outside the session holding it,
 * and the reason it exists: a copy cannot be opened without branching while a
 * writer is there, and "finish in the other window" is not always possible — the
 * window may be one you cannot get back to.
 *
 * It is a kill, and says so. There is no polite signal to send: the CLI has no
 * message loop to close, so ending it is `taskkill /F` and whatever the session
 * had not yet written is gone. What is already in the transcript stays — the file
 * is append-only, and a torn final line is what every tolerant reader here
 * expects.
 *
 * Three things stand between a request and a kill, and they are here rather than
 * in the command so that each can be put to the test on its own:
 *
 *  - one prefix names one conversation, or the request is refused;
 *  - the session homecoming is running inside is never ended, for the same reason it
 *    refuses to close the app it runs in — the kill would take the command with
 *    it, part-way through, leaving nobody to report what happened;
 *  - the pid must still belong to the process the registry named. Windows
 *    reissues pids, and `taskkill /F /T` against a recycled one takes a
 *    stranger's process tree.

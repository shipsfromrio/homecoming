/**
 * Independent proof that a sweep actually closed the gap it reported — the
 * audit that used to be run by hand, after three
 * incidents (one of them lost 2116 records) where a
 * sweep that said "nothing is left" had not, in fact, brought everything.
 *
 * Deliberately not built from the sweep's own bookkeeping — `Outcome.beyond`,
 * `Sidebar.unreached`, the passes' own plans. Two of the three incidents above
 * were bugs *in* that bookkeeping (`fullerOf` choosing by raw total rather
 * than by what the destination lacked; a second round's own writes not
 * being seen by the first round's plan), so checking with the same
 * arithmetic would have missed the same bugs the same way. This instead reads
 * every card the store holds for a conversation, reads every file its id
 * occupies end to end (`Lineage.scanOf` — the same set-difference primitive,
 * but asked fresh, of the id alone, with no sweep state in between), and
 * compares that union against what the target account's own cards reach.
 *
 * Scoped to one `cliSessionId` at a time on purpose, the same way
 * `fileCards.ts` is: a fork is a *different* id sharing a root, and whether
 * every branch got a row is the sweep's branch pass's own question, already
 * reported in `SweepReport.branches`. This measures the other thing the
 * branch pass does not: one id split across two working directories, and
 * whether the target's cards for it, together, reach every record either file
 * holds.
 *
 * One thing this does borrow from the branch pass, deliberately: credit for a
 * fork sibling. A branch whose own records are all shared history — nothing
 * `only` its own, in `branches.ts`'s terms — is a branch the branch pass never
 * brings a row for once *any* sibling of the family is here, because that
 * shared history rides along on whichever branch did arrive (`planBranchCards`,
 * the `kind === 'stale' && branch.only === 0` case). Measuring branch A alone
 * against only the target's own branch-A cards would call that a total gap —
 * every one of its records missing — when the target reaches them all through
 * a sibling row it already has. So a gap's `reached` set is widened with
 * whatever the target's cards for A's fork siblings themselves reach,
 * intersected back with A's own records: an id genuinely split across two
 * *branches* is credited the same way one already split across two *working
 * directories* is, just above.

 * scan that does not consult the ledger will offer those copies as if they were
 * new sessions. Every surface — command, menu, agent — has to go through here.
 *
 * `here` is the destination's own reach, built by the caller with `sidebarOf` —
 * not resolved from an account id here, because the destination's cards can
 * live in a different store than `store` names (an install read cross-store via
 * `--from-store`), and only the caller knows which. Given it, a copy that
 * carried on somewhere `here` cannot reach can be offered back rather than
 * refused as not the last card left. Left out, a caller with no settled
 * destination yet — `homecoming list` without a fixed one — keeps asking only "is
 * this the last one?", which is the answer it always gave.

 * Quit Claude Desktop, optionally do something while it is down, then start it

 *
 * `sweep --restart` has already written everything by the time it calls this,
 * so it passes no `duringGap`; `layout`/`view --restart` write files that are
 * only safe to touch while the app is closed, so they write from inside the
 * gap this opens, between the quit landing and the start going out. Either
 * way this is the one place that decides whether foster may restart the app
 * at all — see `RestartPlan`'s own reasoning about a session the app is
 * itself hosting.
 *
 * `quit`/`start`/`plan` are injectable so a test can drive the gap without a
 * real Claude Desktop, or a real process table, on the machine running it.

.SYNOPSIS
  Installs homecoming — brings Claude Desktop Code sessions from a previous local
  account back into the current account's sidebar. Not affiliated with Anthropic.

.DESCRIPTION
  Intended to be run as:

      irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shipsfromrio/homecoming/<tag>/install.ps1 | iex

  The bundle is downloaded from a tagged GitHub release, never from a moving
  branch, and its SHA256 is verified against the checksum published alongside it
  before anything is written to disk or executed.
#>
# Everything runs inside this script block, never in the caller's scope. The
# advertised install is `irm ... | iex`, and Invoke-Expression runs the text in
# the scope of whoever typed it: without the block, $ErrorActionPreference =
# 'Stop', Set-StrictMode -Version Latest, $repo, $base, $temp and
# Test-NodeVersion all stayed behind in the user's PowerShell session after the
# install, successful or not. scripts/test-install-scope.ps1 pins this.
# `@args` still forwards -Version, -InstallDir and -NoLaunch when the file is
# run directly as `.\install.ps1 -Version vX.Y.Z`.

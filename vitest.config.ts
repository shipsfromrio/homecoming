      // (statements / branches / functions / lines, in each case). ubuntu-latest is the
      // real low point — a first pass at this floor pinned to the Windows numbers above
      // and failed both ubuntu-latest cells in CI on the first push. Each threshold below
      // sits with margin under the ubuntu-latest figure, not under whichever environment
      // happened to be measured last: raise a threshold when coverage genuinely improves
      // by more than that margin; never lower one to let a real drop pass.
